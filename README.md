Simple Calculator Development
I'm excited to share a recent task that I have completedâ€”a simple yet 
effective Calculator Application that performs basic arithmetic operations 
like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Key Features:
Takes user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
Supports all essential arithmetic operations: +, -, *, and /.
Continuously runs, allowing multiple calculations until the user decides to exit.
Handles edge cases such as division by zero with appropriate error messages.
